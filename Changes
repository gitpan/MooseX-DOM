Changes
=======

0.00999_02 - 28 Oct 2008
  * Use metaclasses to initialize the caller class.
  * Add option to provide a default BUILDARGS
  * Add docs

0.00999_01 - 23 Oct 2008
  * Major rewrite. Beware! Backwards incompatible!
    Everything is changed, except for the core idea.
    This release should make it really easy to create DOM based objects.

0.00004 - 12 Aug 2008
  * Refactored the core accessor functionality into MooseX::DOM::Meta::LibXML.
    Most of the generated accessors are now proxies to the meta class.
    (This stuff may change as I understand MOP better)

0.00003 - 11 Aug 2008
  * Implement from_xml/from_file as alternate constructors
  * Fix Makefile.PL dependencies

0.00002 - 11 Aug 2008
  * Implement unimport(), so you can do 'no MooseX::DOM'
  * Implement has_dom_root
  * Implement has_dom_content
  * Automatically generate root node upon set(), if has_dom_root has been
    prorperly declared.
  * Refactor get/set operations so you can specify them at declaration time

0.00001 - 08 Aug 2008
  * Initial release
